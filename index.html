          <p>My search for a new approach has led me to thinking about building applications,
not from what is particular to software development, but from what is universal to humanity.</p>

      <p>Over the span of human history the understanding of three important technologies has migrated from the domains of priests to the domains of elementary school teachers: arithmetic, writing, and the calendar. Now software
technology must join this migration.<p>

      <p>To take a first step in this direct, two changes must occur:</p>

      <ul><li>The conceptual model that people use to think about the internals of
interactive applications must change to something more intuitive than
coding.</li>
<li>The process of building applications must change to something more aligned
with the way our bodies and brains have evolved.</li></ul> 

<p>We must find a way for people to think about and build interactive applications
that will be, in a word, humane.</p>
